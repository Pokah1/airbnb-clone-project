  #### Importance of Design Properties in Mockups
Identifying design properties such as colors, typography, and spacing from mockups is crucial for ensuring visual consistency across the application. It helps developers and designers:
- Maintain brand identity.
- Ensure accessibility through proper contrast and font readability.
